# WindowStore

Steps to run the project
1. Download and install .net sdk 8 if haven't had it yet (https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)
2. clone source code
   
    git clone https://github.com/denis-semiletov/WindowStore.git
   
3. switch into the WindowStore folder
   
    cd .\WindowStore\
   
4. dotnet build
   
5. dotnet run --project ./Server/WindowStore.Server.csproj

or, if you already have installed a corresponding IDE like Visual Studio, VS Code, Rider, etc, just open the solution and run the project from there :)
